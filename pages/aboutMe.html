            <div class="flexbox-item  flexbox-item-2">  I love coding because it is a very challenging thing to do. I may not be the most creative person (as seen in this website) but I love to problem solve and figure things out. Coding is what drives our world today and will only become a bigger part of our world. Coding has helped learn a lot of things and has changed my perspective on everything. I now look at video games and webstites with a whole new view since I now know how/why they work. Coding is also really fun for me and doesn't feel completely like work, it's more fun than anything else in school. 
            </div>
            <div class="flexbox-item  flexbox-item-3">Coding is a really cool and intresting subject. You are able to practice problem solving, creatitivty and researching ability. There is a lot to learn and there is so many ways to complete your work.
